# Advanced-GAP
A modified GAP paradigm to improve class wise localization in images using convolutional layers only. <br />
Original GAP - Follow http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/Zhou_Learning_Deep_Features_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf <br />
Modified GAP - Using classification error change in absence of filter as weight for heatmap generation <br />
newer GAP - Using average excitation level of filter as weight for heatmap generation <br />
